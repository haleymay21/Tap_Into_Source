Tap Into Source

Application built to help users save and share their favorite water sources.

Description
We created an application as a way to help users to save and share their favorite locations of bodies of water.
In the application users will be able to easily save identifiers for future use such as: the type of water source, its accessibility, the tests that have been run (which would decipher its drinkability), and so forth.
Posts will be saved to the users profile and will be available to be filtered through with the assist of user selected tags. We utilized Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. We also utilized MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for our database.
